# dotfiles

I just wanted to find a way to publish my own config files.
Moved computers too much and I like my things standard.

## contains

- nvim init (lazy nvim with WSL support) <br>
- Debian startup script

## How to use
Every folder is a seperate dotfile <br>
With a seperate installation instruction <br> 
With a seperate goal/program <br> 
There should be no inherent dependencies between folders <br>
Use this to your advantage <br>

# TODO

TODO: add crontab possibilities or script
Keep everything up to date with this automatically all the time forever
